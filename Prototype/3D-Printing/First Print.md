For our first steps with 3D printing we used the Anycubic I3 Mega printer. The 3D modeling software was Autodesk Inventor since we lerned it in university. We exported the documents to .stl format and opend them in Cura for slicing. For first prints we useed PLA because it is quite esay to print. Our settings for the "9-gag-logo-cube" were a layer hight of 0.2 and an infill of 20%. The nozell tempreture was 200°C and we sat the bed temprature to 60°C. With these settings we maneged to get a very good print like you will see in the picture below.

The next step was to print a tube or more of a ring with the Anycubic. The problem was, that we wanted to print it standing upwards, so the tention, of the fuluid dynamics inside the reaktion camber, do not breake the zylinder. The exacting force should not be along with the filaments layers. We needed a few prints to achieve this. We had some truble with the suport structures. The main topic with this issue was to find the right angle to start with the suport structures.
