The photometer should also work as an standalone. (No master)
For that reason we need a Display to show the Data.
I was running some tests with the LCD 1602 HD44780 Display from Makershop.de shortly. But so far it is not working. I tried to run the code with a pre-soldered version of the Display with an I2C HD44780 module, but was not able to display anything so far.
The code was from the [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C) and the [I2CScanner Libary](https://github.com/luisllamasbinaburo/Arduino-I2CScanner).

The Problem with the Dysplay may be caused by some badly soldered parts and some oxidation on the Bord like shown in the picture below.
