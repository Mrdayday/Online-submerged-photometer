# Initial Wireing

At the beginning of the projekt the aim was to build a simple photomether. To achieve this we took a Light sensor, in our term the TSL2591 from adafruit, and a LED. 
We wired everthing together like shown in the picture.

With this setup it was possible to set the brightness of the LED to a predicted level.
