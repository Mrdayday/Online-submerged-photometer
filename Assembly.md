First you should start printing all of the things. The photo unit is quite difficult to print with a "singel nozzled" printer due
to the hard to remove support structure. If you have the posibility to use a two nozzled printer you can print a water-soluble
support structure with PVA. The result is shown in the Picture.

Once you have printed all parts you can start assambling them. You can assable them all from the bottem to the top if you want.
There is one part missing at the bottem of the submerged part.
We used a half sphere of steel to get rid of the heat produced by the LED. So it would be good to get one of these or somthing
else of equal thermal conductivity and connect it with thermal paste. All other things you can find [here](https://github.com/Mrdayday/Online-submerged-photometer/blob/master/Components.md)
There is a high chance that you will get inaccurate results if you let the LED heat up. Next step is to connect the wires to 
the light source and push them throug the tiny tunnel on the side. Now glue it together and put fix the glass panels in the frames.

Now it might be useful to plug everything to the [breadboard](https://github.com/Mrdayday/Online-submerged-photometer/blob/master/Wiring.md) and search for the perfect place for the sensor to get the highes value at the busarry(0).
If you find it glue the sensor and solder the cables.

Now connect the neck of the submerged part and lead the wires to the top. Should look like this:

<p>

Now you shold make the stripboard it is a lot of soldering but worth it. You get rid of a lot of cabels that tend to brake or unplug and last but not least it looks better.

<p>

Now solder everthing to the stripboard but everthing that leaves the box sould use a jumperwire connected to the sideslots of the box.
This is everthing that is connected to the submerged part(5 cabels), the bussystem (2 cabels) and the 12V powersuply (2 cabels).
Attach the display and the board to the box. Glue a microscope slide as a display protection to the front, if you want. 

Everything should be ready for commissioning. Attach the box to the reaktor cover and tighten the locknut in the right position.
